What is Generative AI(GenAI)?

Generative AI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) refers to a class of AI models that can create new content — such as text, images, music, code, or even videos — that resembles human-created data. Unlike traditional AI, which classifies or predicts based on existing data, generative AI actually generates new data.
