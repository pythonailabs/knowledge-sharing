What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the branch of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Think of it as teaching machines to “read,” “listen,” “speak,” and even “write” in ways that feel natural to us.
