# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the branch of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Think of it as teaching machines to “read,” “listen,” “speak,” and even “write” in ways that feel natural to us.


**Why NLP Is Important**

1. **Makes talking to computers easy**
   Instead of learning special commands, you just speak or type like you normally would, and your device understands you.

2. **Helps us deal with tons of written stuff**
   There are more emails, tweets, and articles than anyone could ever read. NLP tools quickly sort and find what’s important.

3. **Creates smart language tools**
   From friendly chatbots to instant translations, NLP powers the handy language features we use every day.
